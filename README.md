If Else in C++


THEORY
An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.

Syntax The syntax of an if...else statement in C++ is âˆ’

if(boolean_expression)

{

// statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true

}

else

{

// statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false

}

If the boolean expression evaluates to true, then the if block of code will be executed, otherwise else block of code will be executed

ALGORITHM

Check Even or Odd Algorithm using If-Else:
1.Start

2.Declare an integer variable (e.g., num) to store the number to be checked.

3.Prompt the user to enter the number and store it in the num variable.

4.Use an if-else statement to check whether the number is even or odd:

5.Check if num % 2 == 0 (i.e., if the remainder when dividing num by 2 is equal to 0).

5.If the condition is true, then the number is even.

6.If the condition is false, then the number is odd.

7.Display the result to the user.

8.End

Camparison between 3 numbers and print largest numbers using if else
Compare and Print Largest Number Algorithm using If-Else:

1.Start

2.Declare three integer variables (e.g., num1, num2, and num3) to store the three numbers.

3.Prompt the user to enter the three numbers and store them in the respective variables (num1, num2, and num3).

4.Use a series of if-else statements to compare the three numbers and determine the largest number:

5.Check if num1 is greater than num2 and num3.

If true, num1 is the largest number.
If not, check if num2 is greater than num1 and num3.
If true, num2 is the largest number.
If neither of the above conditions is true, num3 is the largest number.
6.Display the largest number to the user.

7..End
